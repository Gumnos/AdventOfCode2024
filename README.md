# Advent of Code 2024 in awk

As with past years I've done this,
I'm doing the challenges in `awk`.
This repo is tracking my progress.
As usual, I tend to get to about day 18
and then peter out,
with the holiday schedule getting more hectic,
and not wanting to do the "A*" challenge in `awk`.

The repo will have a subdirectory
for each day's challenge,
the `input_sample` for the sample input,
and a pair of `a.awk` and `b.awk` files
completing parts A & B of each challenge.

We'll see how far I take it this year.
